You can make a file that has the script of a command inside. When the file is executed, the command is executed. Example: make a file called fanta.sh, edit the content to have ls inside. When fanta.sh is executed using command bash fanta.sh it does the same as would ls. I don't know what is cn or LDAP other than what could be found with a quick google search. To complete this assignment you have to search uid or user id from some list. This list can be found locally on a computer somewhere in /etc/ or some other place. Each user has their own ID. This applies not only to human users but also machinery inside your computer that need their own uid:s for functionality reasons. I'm not sure if this works the same way in windows, but for UNIX based systems it seems to apply.

For reverse order, you also need to use a specifier. Most likely this is done with the grep command (man grep).
