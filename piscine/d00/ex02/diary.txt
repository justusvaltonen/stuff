There is no way I'm redoing this for fun. This is somewhat a copy of the last assignment but with a little bit of extra. More files and also links between files. As my first remake I spent 6 hours on figuring out how to get the timestamp on one of the links right before I read the pdf files next page that told to ignore that one. It was fun still. I learned a lot on different stuff just by researching a silly timestamp.

Later on, way after the bootcamp I started to understand the idea behind this assignment. These are widely used properties and making us loose our temper makes us remember these thing for the rest of our lives. Human learning resembles machine learning in many ways. 

At that time I didnt know this, even tho I started to find resembles on my way of thinking and how I believed computers operate. Waking up the next day was always psychedelic. Stuff is in my head and I have no idea how it got there.

Before I got to bed I wanted to cry, laugh, strangle someone and couldnt wait for the next day.
