I'm so sad that I havent had the time to put up a stable server to experiment on this one. I did have a virtual server that I used but now it is seized by the police (not my fault, someone elses). I'll get back to this when I have the time to get a couple of new computers. I'm an old fashioned guy, I like to have the server physically humming somewhere near. I want to be able to touch it, fondle it, pet it. As I said my social contacts have been replaced with electronical ones.
