If we read carefully the assignment, we are now given the addresses as input.
In the previous assignment there was no mention about the addresses. We do know
that no matter how many stars we use, they all refer to the address of the same
integer. There might be a clue that the ex01 was wrong. Anyhow I choose to
ignore this for now and just make the swap.

	Come to think of it, it should be ok because what was asked was done.
