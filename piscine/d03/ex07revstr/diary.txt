	Looking at my own code from way back makes me feel like an idiot. I can
see what I was thinking and why. Just the knowledge is lacking. This is a
disease that is very common. The time one can spend on finding out the answer to
a simple problem can never be underestimated. Right now I'm doing these
assignments all over again. The initial answers were just plain bad. Finding the
right source of information that is human-readable is pain in the ASS. Logic
behind this one is not the hard part, but the knowledge of how the function can
be called was not the easiest to find out.
	Now it's quite clear and a given that the function is called with a
pointer called str. The pointer points to an array that is an area reserved in
the memory for a consecutive string of characters. What is returned is the 
memory area of where the pointer points to.
