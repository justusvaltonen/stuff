It is creatable. Before every special character put a "/". Not going to make this since it's a pain in the airbnb. Also noticable that depending on your text editor, the file can be a byte too big. I think it has something to do with the programming of the editor. Maybe an editor reads the content of a file as a string and therefore adds an extra null terminator or something. EMACS or NANO could make this one the correct way.
	Most likely I'm wrong on the reasoning since popular editors shouldn't be open for exploits. From the previous assignments there was a case where a file was made and a maximum size was pre-determined. I haven't tested this and for now won't.
