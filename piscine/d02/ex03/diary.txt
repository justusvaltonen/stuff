	Greetings traveller! This assignment was an easy one if you know the basics of C.
Only thing that I can think of extra in this one is lower and uppercase characters.
The ASCII value of n and N is different. While it is possible to name our functions with uppercase letters, it is not advisable.
Uppercase letters are usually used for different things we discover later.
There is a pdf thenorme or something like that in the piscine folder.
It holds advise on practises that were used in the bootcamp. Most of them make sense, some don't.
For a person new to programming, the instructions are funreadable.

Tednacious D - Tribute: {He asked us: "*sngrf* Be you angels?" And we said: 
"Ney, we are but men, ROCK! AAaahaAA, AAAah aahAAha!"}

	Even though rock lyrics can hold unneccessary capitals and exclamation marks, they should be avoided in C.
Some also say that there is something demonic in pointers (*), but theyre not that bad.
