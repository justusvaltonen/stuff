	I'm a bit tired after the last assignment but let's see how it goes.
It's always great to notice that tens of hours of study was sort of waste of
time. Of course it wasn't because I learned a lot during that time, but still it
was a battle. The current assignment looks like it could be done via int array.
At the first glance something I've never succesfully done is needed here.

	On the last assignment I'm not sure if I got the right answer since
it's hard to test with only one computer. I need to get the rasberry so I can 
test with a crappy enviroment. The current assignment seems quite easy once I 
get my head together first.

	OK, so back to this one. It is clear that I'm bored because of the time
I've spent on this one. At first this seemed an easy one but since I'm missing
a gear in my brain, this was hard. I still don't have the totally correct
answer since the norm, but I got it to work.

	The trick that made a difference for me was to divide the program in to
small functions and calling them over and over again. There is propably better
ways of solving this. I made notes on another file "try1.c". Whenever a is 3 or
bigger and printing is done afterwards, there is an error. Also endcondition is
missing along with a bunch of other stuff.

	Other thing that might come in handy is remembering that arr[n] <
arr[n + 1] always. Also don't go out of bounds of the first initialized array
area. This applies when comparing or changing the memory area.
